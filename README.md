# Iterable Demo  

This small React.js app utilizes the Iterable API to create a new profile in the Iterable database. A user enters their first name and email to create or update a profile. This page also houses the functionality to receive inApp messages and create new events within an account.

A static HTML page from the inApp Messages ```GET``` request is displayed using npm ```html-to-react```.
